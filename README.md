# Battleship
## EECS 448 - Project 1

This is a basic battleship game created as our submission for project 1 for EECS 448 at the University of Kansas.

## Structure Info
This project has been wired up to use Vue.js to help organize components of the game.

These components are defined in files that end in the `.component.js` extension, and are located in the `src/components/` directory.

The entry point for the project is the `index.html`. This file contains the basic logic for loading Vue, and adding the game board to the page.

Obviously, we'll flesh out the look-and-feel as we go along. This is just a basic starter for now.

## How to Run
The easiest way to run this project is by creating a basic static web server using Python. This is super simple:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt to the root of this project (i.e. the directory this file is in).
2. Start the server: `python -m http.server`

This will start a web server on port 8000. You can then run the game by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ from a web browser.
